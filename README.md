## Notes
1. Default year for reservation date
2. Menu displays what dates are free and which are full
  * Make a clear destinction between what dates are full and when it is closed
  * Drop down menu showing the available dates to reserve, in the menu it shows how many seats are available on that specific day
  * Fix backend to show available seats on that day
  * Make it so that you can change what dates are available
